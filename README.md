# medmod

This jamovi module allows you to do simple mediation and moderation in [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org). The module is still in beta development so any comments and contributions are well appreciated.

You can already try out the module by downloading the [medmod.jmo](https://github.com/raviselker/medmod/raw/master/medmod.jmo) file and [sideloading](http://imgur.com/a/mFv7t) it into jamovi.
